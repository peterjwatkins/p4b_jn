    "Chapter 12, graphics, looked at drawing things on the screen, and handling basic user interactions, like mouse clicks. The principles developed in that chapter return here, though the overall goal of these two chapters is to develop basic Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that a user can interact with. This first section focuses on placing widgets in windows in a sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next chapter will demonstrate how to let the user interact with the GUI. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a library to handle most of the low-level components of GUI generation. We could use the graphics module to draw every pixel of a cancel button, every pixel of an okay button, every pixel of a check box, and so on. We'd then have to add appropriate hooks for mouse interactions, and draw every pixel of a check mark in the check box when the user clicks in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Tkinter, we'll add a check box, an okay button, a cancel button, and then tell those widgets what to do when the user interacts with them. Much easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main complication with Tkinter is that it's a wrapper for a completely different language called tcl (if you've used VMD or NAMD, those run on tcl).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the most useful documentation for Tkinter is not, actually, written for Python. It can be found at http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm\n",
    "and  you should use it as you read this chapter to see how the tcl commands are implemented in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official Python documentation is available at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html but it does not provide the detailed descriptions that are available in the Tcl/Tk documentation. "
